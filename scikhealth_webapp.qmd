**Customizable Indicator Selection**

Managers can select from over 100 performance indicators organized across the five key dimensions. The interface allows filtering by time period (2015-2024 slider), selecting specific indicator categories (Publication Productivity, Publication Impact, Publication Talent, Patents Data, Clinical Trials Data, Datasets Data, Altmetric Data, Grants Data), and exporting filtered data as CSV for further analysis.

Each dimension offers detailed sub-indicators. For example:
- **Publication Productivity**: Total annual publications, average authors per article, percentage of Open Access articles
- **Altmetric Data**: Number of articles with Altmetric scores, percentage with Altmetric > 0, mentions by platform (Facebook, RSS blogs, Google+)
- **Patents Data**: Average institutions involved per patent, distinct jurisdictions, number of patents per jurisdiction, Kind Code classifications, top research fields by ANZSRC 2020, CPC categories
