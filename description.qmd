## Overview

This section provides detailed metadata documentation for the variables used in the SciK-Health project datasets. Each block corresponds to a thematic group of indicators derived from OpenAlex and other integrated sources.\
The indicators are designed to support reproducible, comparative research on Italian Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ“Š Bibliometric Dimension

These indicators describe the scientific production volume, authorship patterns, and collaboration dynamics of AHSCs.\
They are primarily computed using publication metadata from OpenAlex and enriched with journal quality metrics from SCOPUS.

**\*\*\*** Citation trend is a metric assigned to articles by OpenAlex starting from 2012.

### ðŸ”¹ Collaboration

| **Variable**       | **Description**                                                        |

### ðŸ”¹ Talent

These indicators focus on the concentration and distribution of scientific contributions across internal and external authors.\
They provide insights into the presence of high-performing individuals, institutional equity, and authorship leadership roles.

| topAUbyCit | List of top authors by total citations |
| topAUbyCit_TC | Total citations associated with each author in `topAUbyCit` |
| topAUINbyCit | List of top internal authors by total citations |
| topAUINbyCit_TC | Total citations associated with internal authors in `topAUINbyCit` |
| topAUINbyCit_norm_byYear | List of top internal authors by normalized citations per year\*\*\* |
| topAUINbyCit_TC_norm_byYear | Normalized citations associated with internal authors in `topAUINbyCit_norm_byYear` |

\* The weight assigned to each author is fractional (considering both publication count and co-authorship).\
\*\* Gini concentration computed using the number of published articles per author as weight.\
\*\*\* Top cited authors, where citation counts are normalized by dividing each articleâ€™s citation count by the average citations of all articles published in the same year.

### ðŸ”¹ Topics

This group of indicators summarizes the conceptual and thematic content of the scientific output produced by AHSCs.\
It includes hierarchical concept levels (from general disciplines to specific biomedical entities), MeSH terms, authors' keywords, and text-mined bigrams from titles and abstracts.

| **Variable** | **Description** |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| topConcept_L0 | Top level 0 concepts (general disciplines, e.g., MEDICINE, BIOLOGY) |
| topFreq_L0 | Frequencies associated with top level 0 concepts |
| topConcept_L1 | Top level 1 concepts (subdisciplines or specializations, e.g., CARDIOLOGY, SURGERY) |
| topFreq_L1 | Frequencies associated with top level 1 concepts |

| topMESH_n | Frequencies of the top MeSH terms |
| topprimary_topic.display_name | Top primary topics |

## ðŸ“£ Altmetrics: Social & Digital Attention

This section includes indicators that capture the online visibility, public engagement, and media attention of scientific publications produced by AHSCs.\
Metrics are collected via the Altmetric API and provide aggregated and disaggregated views of attention across platforms such as social media, blogs, news outlets, and policy documents.

| **Variable** | **Description** |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| nDoc_wALTM | Number of articles in the year with at least one Altmetric Score (Altmetric Score \> 0) |
| percDoc_wALTM | Percentage of articles with Altmetric Score \> 0 out of total articles published |
| medianAltmetricScore | Altmetric Score value, an aggregated indicator of online attention (median) |
| cited_by_accounts_count | Number of unique accounts mentioning the article (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_fbwalls_count | Number of Facebook wall mentions (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_feeds_count | Number of mentions in RSS feeds and blogs (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_gplus_count | Number of mentions on Google+ (historical only; mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_msm_count | Number of mentions in mainstream media (newspapers, magazines, etc.) (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_patents_count | Number of mentions in patents (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_peer_review_sites_count | Number of mentions on peer review sites (e.g., PubPeer) (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_policies_count | Number of citations in policy documents (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_posts_count | Total mentions in posts (including blogs, forums, etc.) (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_rdts_count | Number of mentions in Reddit threads (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_rh_count | Number of mentions in Research Highlights (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_tweeters_count | Number of Twitter/X users who mentioned the article (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_videos_count | Number of mentions in video content (e.g., YouTube) (mean, min, and max) |
| cited_by_wikipedia_count | Number of citations on Wikipedia (mean, min, and max) |
| cohorts.com | Number of general public users interacting with the article (mean, min, and max) |
| cohorts.doc | Number of interactions by professionals (clinicians, operators, policy makers) |

-   For all Altmetric `cited_by` indicators, mean, minimum, and maximum values were calculated based only on the top 25th percentile of the distribution. This approach was adopted because a large proportion of publications either lack an Altmetric score or report zero activity across most altmetric sources, which would bias overall statistics.
