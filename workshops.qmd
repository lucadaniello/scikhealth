<!-- **Location:** Department of Economics and Statistics (DiSES), University of Naples Federico II -->

<!-- This advanced workshop examines the relationship between research performance and healthcare outcomes in Italian public Academic Health Science Centres. It explores whether academic research drives healthcare quality, patient choice, and case-mix complexity, using bibliometric and scientometric methods. -->

<!-- The event includes a session on bibliographic databases for systematic literature reviews—from classic to AI-powered solutions—delivered by Prof. Nicola De Bellis (University of Modena & Reggio Emilia).
