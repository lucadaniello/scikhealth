    "text": "📚 OpenAlex\nOpenAlex serves as our primary bibliographic data source. It is an open, freely accessible platform that offers a wide-ranging collection of scientific publications, author metadata, institutional affiliations, and citation relationships.\nUnlike proprietary alternatives such as Web of Science or Scopus, OpenAlex ensures broader inclusion—particularly of smaller or underrepresented institutions—and enables full integration with open-source analysis workflows.\nFor this project, we extracted publication-level data from OpenAlex via its API, using institutional affiliations as the main search criterion.\nTo improve the accuracy and completeness of institutional matching, we relied on the Research Organization Registry (ROR), a global and community-led system for identifying research institutions. This allowed us to account for official names, common abbreviations, and alternative spellings of AHSCs.\n\n\n📄 Scientific Publications\nAll scientific publications associated with Italian public AHSCs were retrieved from OpenAlex.\nTo ensure data consistency and comparability across institutions and time, we applied the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:\n\nDocument Type: Only articles were selected. Other formats—such as book chapters, conference proceedings, and editorials—were excluded due to their lower citation visibility and limited standardization.\n\n\n\nTimeframe: Articles published from 2000 to 2024 were considered.\n\nLanguage: Articles written in English were included, to ensure coverage of internationally visible and standardized research output.\n\nThis filtering strategy was designed to focus the analysis on high-quality, peer-reviewed research.\n\n\n\n🧠 Concepts\nOpenAlex provides a rich classification system for the scientific content of each publication through a set of hierarchical entities known as Concepts. These are semantically defined research topics assigned automatically to each article based on content analysis and citation patterns.\nFor the SciK-Health project, we extracted all Concepts associated with each publication authored by AHSCs. This allowed us to reconstruct the cognitive structure of each institution’s research activity, and to classify their scientific output by discipline, specialization, and thematic evolution.\nEach Concept was archived with its unique identifier, name, and relevance score. This facilitates advanced analyses such as clustering, thematic mapping, and comparative profiling across AHSCs.\n\n\n\n👤 Authorships\nFor each article, the full authorship information was extracted and archived from OpenAlex.\nThis includes, for every author, several information, such as: - Full name and position in the author list - Corresponding author status - OpenAlex unique author ID - Affiliation at the time of publication\nThe availability of the affiliation author ID (when present) enabled us to enrich each author record with additional layers of information. Specifically, for each publication, we identified: - whether an author was internal to the AHSC under analysis (based on institutional affiliation at the time); - whether the internal author was also listed as first, last, or corresponding author.\nThis information was crucial for measuring the strategic contribution of internal researchers to scientific production, and for evaluating leadership roles in collaborative research."

Through an integrated data pipeline, spanning bibliometric records, clinical trials, patents, and grants, the app provides a unified, role-based dashboard that allows users to explore the Italian health research ecosystem with a single query.\nSciK-Health enables the discovery of disease-related expertise, institutional profiles, and innovation trends. Users can navigate a dynamic interface that synthesizes complex data into interpretable visualizations, helping identify centres of excellence, leading researchers (i.e., medstars), and patterns of collaboration and funding. Designed to support informed decision-making and foster transparency, the app stands as a novel digital tool at the intersection of health research, open science, and public engagement.\n\n\n\nScientific Knowledge and Healthcare Quality: A Multidimensional Assessment of 49 Italian Academic Health Science Centres\nAuthors: Alaimo L.

The project explores the impact of scientific production on the quality and effectiveness of patient care within the Italian healthcare system, with a particular focus on Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs). These centres, characterized by diverse governance models and institutional arrangements, represent a complex field of analysis.\nWe examine 49 public AHSCs located in both metropolitan and smaller urban contexts, which vary significantly in their organizational configurations and in the nature of the hospital–university linkage. To assess and compare their performance and scientific integration, we develop composite indicators using a range of methodological approaches. These synthetic indices aim to capture multidimensional aspects of the centres’ structure and output, offering a tool for understanding the relationship between scientific activity and healthcare delivery across heterogeneous institutional settings.\n\n\n\nDoes Clinical Research Improve the Quality of Care? Evidence from Italy\nAuthors: Aria M.1,3, Beraldo S.1, Collaro M.1, Cuccurullo C.1,2,3, Gnasso A.1,3\n1Department of Economics and Statistics, University of Naples Federico II\n2Department of Economics, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli\n3K-Synth academic spin-off, University of Naples Federico II\n\n\nView Abstract\n\nThis study examines an often-overlooked dimension in quality assessment models: the institutional mission of healthcare providers. While some institutions are deeply engaged in clinical research, others are exclusively focused on delivering patient care. It is therefore reasonable to expect that differences in core missions may be associated with variations in healthcare quality.\nThe analysis proceeds in two steps. First, it explores the empirical relationship between research intensity and quality indicators, testing whether a research-oriented mission is linked to better healthcare outcomes. Second, it compares quality indicators between research-focused and care-focused providers to identify potential heterogeneity related to institutional orientation.\nThe study integrates data from Academic Health Science Centers (AHSCs) - including measures of research intensity - with information from the Italian National Outcomes Program (Programma Nazionale Esiti, PNE), which provides a range of indicators on health outcomes. The findings offer new insights into the added value of clinical research, enhancing our understanding of how the institutional mission of healthcare providers shapes the quality of care.\n\n\n\nGovernance and Performance of Academic Health Science Centers: Insights from a Qualitative Study in Italy\nAuthors: Belfiore A.1,4, Cuccurullo C.2,3,4\n1Università Pegaso, Italia\n2Department of Economics and Statistics, University of Naples Federico II\n3Department of Economics, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli\n4K-Synth academic spin-off, University of Naples Federico II\n\n\nView Abstract\n\nIn contemporary health systems, Academic Health Science Centers (AHSCs) must integrate care, research, and education to remain sustainable. Yet, this “triple mission” entails complex challenges often neglected in planning and assessment.\nThe Sci-K-Health project explored these issues through three components: a scientometric analysis of 200,000 Italian AHSC publications (2000–2024), a nationwide survey of CEOs (n=49, 14 responses), and interviews with four CEOs from diverse contexts. Results highlight that functional integration across missions is neither automatic nor uniform, requiring new governance models based on horizontal collaboration.\nCurrent evaluation frameworks overlook the added value of academic integration, and regulatory misalignments hinder effective synergies. The study advocates for a renewed national framework that formally supports AHSCs’ integrative role, emphasizing their capacity for rapid, high-impact responses—particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "text": "🧱 Structure of the SciK-Health Database\nThe SciK-Health project relies on a relational database designed to represent and manage the key entities and relationships that characterize scientific research in the public Italian AHC domain. This model enables the integration of heterogeneous data sources while maintaining consistency and integrity through relational constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📌 Main Tables and Entities\n• AHC (Academic Health Center): stores information about the academic and healthcare institutions involved.\n• Patent: contains data on patents, including titles, inventors, and registration dates.\n• Dataset: describes datasets used or produced in research, along with associated metadata.\n• Grant: includes funding details such as granting bodies, amounts, and durations.\n• Clinical_Trial: provides information on clinical studies, including phases, objectives, and results.\n• Researcher: contains researcher profiles, affiliations, and areas of expertise.\n• Article: archives scientific publications, including references and abstracts.\n\n\n🔗 Relationships Between Entities\nRelationships between entities are modeled using associative tables that implement foreign keys to preserve referential integrity. For example:\n• ASSOCIATED_WITH: links AHCs with Patents, Datasets, and Grants.\n• CONDUCTED_AT: connects Clinical_Trials with AHCs.\n• WRITTEN_BY: associates Articles with Researchers.\n• CITES: manages citation relationships between Articles.\n• COLLABORATED_WITH: represents collaboration networks among Researchers.\nThese relationships are implemented through join tables that contain the primary keys of the involved entities, ensuring data consistency via referential constraints.\n\n\n⚙️ Technical Characteristics\n• Normalization: the tables are structured to minimize redundancy and improve query efficiency.\n• Integrity Constraints: use of primary and foreign keys to enforce data consistency. • Data Types: strict definition of data types for each attribute (e.g., strings, integers, dates).\n• Indexing: indexes are created on key attributes to optimize query performance.\nThis relational design enables SciK-Health to efficiently manage the complex and interconnected information typical of scientific research in the healthcare sector."

    "text": "SciK-Health\nProject Code: 2022825Y5E\nCUP: E53D2300611006\nFunding Scheme: PRIN 2022 (Progetti di Ricerca di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale)\n\nScientific Knowledge in Health (SciK-Health) is a national research project funded under the PRIN 2022 programme. It investigates the role of scientific production in shaping the quality and effectiveness of patient care within the Italian healthcare system, focusing specifically on Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs).\nAHSCs are institutions that integrate healthcare delivery, medical education, and research. Their mission is to provide advanced clinical services, train future healthcare professionals, and promote scientific innovation. In recent years, these centres have played an increasingly strategic role in connecting scientific knowledge with clinical practice.\nDespite the growing emphasis on research and innovation, little is known about how scientific output actually translates into measurable improvements in patient care. SciK-Health addresses this gap by combining bibliometric and scientometric analysis with healthcare performance data, aiming to explore the relationship between research activity and clinical outcomes.\n\n\n\nProject Overview\nAcademic Health Science Centres (AHSCs) pursue a threefold strategic mission.\nFirst, they train healthcare professionals to treat and reduce the burden of disease using increasingly effective and valuable health technologies.\nSecond, they serve as innovation hubs for new treatment methods, health technologies, tools, and digital solutions, with the aim of making the European health industry more pioneering, sustainable, and globally competitive.\nThird, they provide advanced, high-quality care through the adoption of groundbreaking and data-driven solutions that are tailored to patient needs.\nBalancing these three missions is inherently complex, and several side effects have been documented—such as strategic ambiguity and organizational tension. While some studies have explored the impact of teaching on patient care, little is known about how the missions interact, particularly regarding the role of research in improving care delivery.\nDisciplines such as bibliometrics and scientometrics have made it possible to measure and analyze scientific outputs. The research production of AHSCs includes not only scientific publications but also clinical trials, patents, research grants, and social impact (e.g., altmetrics). While these outputs are typically measured separately, they remain underutilized as indicators of health system performance.\n\n\n\nAHSC in the Italian Context\nThis research is focused on the Italian AHSCs, which represent a particularly diverse and dynamic field of investigation due to the heterogeneity of their missions, governance models, and institutional relationships. In particular, we studied 49 public centres distributed across both metropolitan areas and smaller cities. They differ significantly in terms of organizational structure, operational scope, and the formal ties between hospitals and universities.\nOver the past decades, Italian AHSCs have undergone significant institutional and regulatory transformations, shaped by reforms in the healthcare system (Legislative Decree 517/1999), in the university sector (Legislative Decree 240/2010), and by changes in regional health reimbursement policies.\nBased on their institutional configurations and the nature of their university–hospital integration, Italian AHSCs can be classified into three main categories:\n\nFully integrated AHSCs, historically managed by universities (AOU SSN): N = 9, covering approximately 18.37%\n\nAffiliated AHSCs, autonomous hospitals integrated with a School of Medicine (AOU): N = 17, around 34.69%\n\nResearch-focused AHSCs, prioritizing research over teaching missions (IRCCS): N = 23, approximately 46.94%\n\nThese institutions also vary in ownership (public, private, or non-profit), service profiles, and the availability of facilities such as emergency departments.\nWhile benchmarking studies—such as those conducted by the Interregional Performance Evaluation System (IRPES)—have focused primarily on healthcare delivery and performance, they have largely overlooked the systematic evaluation of research output and scientific impact.\n\n\n\nResearch Contribution\nSciK-Health Its aim is to offer a science-based decision-making tool for citizens, healthcare professionals, academic leaders, and policymakers mapping and evaluating the scientific production of Italian public Academic Health Science Centres from 2000 to the present.\nThe project unfolds in four main phases:\n\n🧩 Data Collection and Integration\nWe collect and integrate data from multiple sources — including OpenAlex, Dimensions, and Altmetric — covering a broad range of scientific outputs:\n\nPeer-reviewed publications\nClinical trials\nCompetitive research grants\nPatents\nAltmetric data (social and policy impact)\n\n\nData are cleaned, normalized, and stored in a unified, longitudinal dataset covering 52 public AHSCs.\n\n🗺️ Science Mapping and Indicator Development\nWe apply science mapping techniques to examine the conceptual and social structure of AHSC research. In parallel, we calculate a wide set of performance indicators across five key dimensions: 📚 Bibliometric – 🌐 Social & Digital – 🧬 Industrial Impact & Research Innovation – 🧪 Clinical Research – 💶 Funding & grant. These are then aggregated into a composite score reflecting the overall scientific capacity of each AHSC.\n🌐 Tool Design and Dissemination We are developing two interactive tools:\n\nSciK-Health Web App – An open-access tool offering intuitive access to key research indicators and thematic trends. It supports health literacy, scientific navigation, and public decision-making.\nR-daisy – A second-level dashboard designed for institutional users (managers, donors, agencies). It summarizes AHSC research performance into a single daisy-like score, available upon request only.\n\n✅ Validation and Engagement The final phase involves a validation process through focus groups and stakeholder consultation, involving:\n\n3 academic hospitals\n1 research hospital\n1 regional health agency\nThese institutions are formally engaged through letters of intent."
